# Problem 1

## Load the penguins dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Write a short description of the penguins dataset

``` r
# names / values of important variables
variable_name = names(penguins)
species_name = levels(penguins$species)
island_name = levels(penguins$island)
sex_name = levels(penguins$sex)

## number of each species
n_adelie = sum(pull(penguins, species) == "Adelie")
n_gentoo = sum(pull(penguins, species) == "Gentoo")
n_hinstrap = sum(pull(penguins, species) == "Chinstrap")

## bill length
mean_bill_length = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        pull(bill_length_mm) %>%
        mean() %>%
        round(digits = 1)

max_bill_length = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        pull(bill_length_mm) %>%
        max() 

min_bill_length = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        pull(bill_length_mm) %>%
        min() 
        
 ## bill depth
mean_bill_depth = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        pull(bill_depth_mm) %>%
        mean() %>%
        round(digits = 1)

max_bill_depth = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        pull(bill_depth_mm) %>%
        max() 

min_bill_depth = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        pull(bill_depth_mm) %>%
        min() 
        
 ## flipper length
mean_flipper_length = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        pull(flipper_length_mm) %>%
        mean() %>%
        round(digits = 0)

max_flipper_length = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        pull(flipper_length_mm) %>%
        max() 

min_flipper_length = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        pull(flipper_length_mm) %>%
        min() 

## body mass
mean_body_mass = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        pull(body_mass_g) %>%
        mean() %>%
        round(digits = 0)

max_body_mass = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        pull(body_mass_g) %>%
        max() 

min_body_mass = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        pull(body_mass_g) %>%
        min() 
        
 
# size of the dataset 
row = nrow(penguins)
col = ncol(penguins)

# mean flipper length
mean_flipper_length = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        pull(flipper_length_mm) %>%
        mean() %>%
        round(digits = 2)
```

There are 8 variables in this dataset: species, island, bill_length_mm,
bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.

The levels of species are Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo, the levels of
island are Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen and the levels of sex are female,
male.

For the species, there are 152 Adelie penguins, 124 Gentoo penguins and
68 H Instrap penguins in this dataset.

The mean of bill length is 44 mm, the maximum is 59.6 mm and the minimum
is 32.1 mm.

The mean of bill depth is 17.2 mm, the maximum is 21.5 mm and the
minimum is 13.1 mm.

The mean of flipper length is 200.97 mm, the maximum is 231 mm and the
minimum is 172 mm.

The mean of body mass is 4207 g, the maximum is 6300 g and the minimum
is 2700 g.

Totally, there are 344 rows and 8 columns in the dataset.

## Make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x)

``` r
# draw the plot
penguine_plot = penguins %>%
        drop_na() %>%
        ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) +  geom_point(aes(color = species))

# save the plot
ggsave("hw1_scatterplot.pdf", plot = penguine_plot)
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

# Problem 2

## Create a dataframe

``` r
df = tibble (
        vec_norm = rnorm(n = 10),
        vec_log = vec_norm > 0,
        vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
        vec_fac = factor(c("High", "Low", "Medium", "High", "Low", "Low", "Medium", "High", "Low", "Medium"))
)
```

## Take the mean of each variable in the dataframe

``` r
# mean of the random sample from standard normal distribution
mean_norm = df %>%
        pull(vec_norm) %>%
        mean()

# mean of logical vector
mean_log = df %>%
        pull(vec_log) %>%
        mean()

# mean of character vector
mean_char = df %>%
        pull(vec_char) %>%
        mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

``` r
# mean of factor vector
mean_fac = df %>%
        pull(vec_fac) %>%
        mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

When calculating the mean, the numeric and logical vector works while
the character and factor vector fail to work.

## Convert variables to numeric

``` r
# convert logical variable to numeric and calculate the mean
mean_log_num = df %>%
        pull(vec_log) %>%
        as.numeric() %>%
        mean()

# convert character variable to numeric and calculate the mean
mean_char_num = df %>%
        pull(vec_char) %>%
        as.numeric() %>%
        mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean(.): NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
# convert factor variable to numeric and calculate the mean
mean_fac_num = df %>%
        pull(vec_fac) %>%
        as.numeric() %>%
        mean()
```

After converting to numeric, the `mean` function can work for logical
and factor vector. However, it still fails to work for character vector.
This is because the `as.numeric` function sets TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0
for the logical vector and sets “High” to 1, “Low” to 2, “Medium” to 3
for the factor vector. All values in character vector return NA.
